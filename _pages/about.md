I am a doctoral student at the [Max Planck School of Cognition](https://cognition.maxplanckschools.org/en/doctoral-candidates/bianca-serio).

My research investigates variability in principles of macroscale brain organization, particularly focusing on sex differences. I use computational methods to capitalize on open multicale neuroimaging (MRI) data, analyzing both large samples from population-level studies and small samples following a dense sampling and deep phenotyping approach. In my work, I further consider steroid hormones as key drivers of variability as well as potential risk factors for affective disorders. Accordingly, I also take a developmental approach to investigate the emergence of sex differences in affective psychopathology during puberty. Ultimately, I aim for my research to provide theoretical contributions to the field of sex differences, and hope to translate my findings to real world applications with implications for women's health.

I am physically based at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/employees/125719) in Leipzig (Germany), in the [Cognitive Neurogenetics](https://cng-lab.github.io/) Lab led by Dr. Sofie Valk. I am also affiliated with [Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/serio_b) and [Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf](https://www.uniklinik-duesseldorf.de/patienten-besucher/klinikeninstitutezentren/institut-fuer-systemische-neurowissenschaften/teamkontakt) (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf).
