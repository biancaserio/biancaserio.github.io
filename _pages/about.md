 <br>I am a doctoral student at the [Max Planck School of Cognition](https://cognition.maxplanckschools.org/en/doctoral-candidates/bianca-serio).

I use computational methods to study variability in principles of macroscale brain organization. I am particularly interested in sex differences in cortical functional organization, including the investigation of steroid hormones as key drivers of variability.

Ultimately, I aim for my research to provide theoretical contributions to the field of sex differences, and hope to translate my findings to real world applications with implications for women's health. <br><br><br><br>

I am physically based at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences](https://www.cbs.mpg.de/employees/125719) in Leipzig, in the [Cognitive Neurogenetics](https://cng-lab.github.io/) Lab led by Dr. Sofie Valk. I am further affiliated with [Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/profile/serio_b) and [Universitätsklinikum Düsseldorf](https://www.uniklinik-duesseldorf.de/patienten-besucher/klinikeninstitutezentren/institut-fuer-systemische-neurowissenschaften/teamkontakt) (Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf).
